# shol

Simple header only library for C++. Containing various useful functions. Like python like print support for conatiners using cout see [std_cout](examples/std_cout.cpp).

I've tried to make it as cross platform as possible. But there is no guarantee. Examples are tested for Windows, MacOX and Linux.

## Install

Just copy the headers:
    Copy the [include](include) folder to your build tree and use a C++14 compiler.

---

## Examples

Examples can be build using [cmake](https://cmake.org/).

First create a build directory
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
